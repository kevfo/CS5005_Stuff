# Imapct of News Media

Journalists have numerous responsibilities - for instance:

1.  Informing the public on matters and topics
1.  Educating the public on and raising awareness on a certain topic
1.  Nation building 
1.  Acting as a watchman

Furthermore, journalists are also influenced by external parties - for instance, the government, their managers (i.e., bosses), their family, their finances, advertises, and political figures to name a few!

## Filters of Mass Media

According to the book *Manufacturing Consent*, there are five filters of mass media:

1.  Media ownership
1.  Advertising money (i.e., paying for the audience as a product)
1.  Media elites (i.e., ensuring complicity)
1.  Flack
1.  Common enemy

```

The above diagram lists several terms suggesting why it is that individuals consume news media:

1.  **Surveillance Gratification**

    Individuals have a tendency to use news media as a way of gaining information about their social environments.
    
1.  **Anticipated Interactions**

    Individuals use social media as a way of finding social resources for future conversations with others.
    
1.  **Guidance**

    Individuals may use news media as a gauge for how they should behave and feel (about a certain topic).
    
1.  **Need for Cognition**

    This is a need to understand and find meaning in an experimental world.
    
1.  **Risk Perception**

    This refers to how seriously perceive a problem.
    
### Passive Consumption

There are two general ways that individuals can passively consume news:

1.  **Incidental Exposure**

    Individuals are coincidentally exposed to news media in spite of them not searching for it.
    
1.  **"News-find-me" Phenomenon**

    This is the belief that important news will eventually find its way to the individual.
    
### Agenda Setting Theory 

This is the belief that although the press may not be able to tell what to think, it can still tell you what *to think about*.

## Message Framing

> Framing has theoretical roots in prospect theory, which states that presenting the same information about risk in different ways alters peopleâ€™s perspectives, preferences and actions
>
> -- Kahneman & Tversky, 1979

**Message framing** is an idea that utilizes emphasis, exclusion, elaboration, and selection to deliver content.

```{r echo = F, fig.cap = "Examples of Gain-Framed and Loss-Framed Messages", fig.align = "center"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/wk8/framing.jpg")
```

People are generally risk-averse when it comes time to face losses and vice vesa.

## Spiral of Silence

```{r echo = F, fig.cap = "Spiral of Silence Illustration", fig.align = "center"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/wk8/silence.jpg")
```

The **spiral of silence** states that individuals do not feel comfortable speaking out for themselves if they feel that they are in the minority.

The above is due to the fear of isolation.

### Some Assumptions

There are five general assumptions behind this theory:

1.  Individuals' opinions are distributed according to some distribution.
1.  One's willingness to expose their own views varies according to their expression in 1.
1.  There is a positive correlation between present and future assessments.
1.  If there is a divergence, how the individual expects things to unfold will determine whether or not they will speak out.
