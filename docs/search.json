A coder is a person who classifies content into categories - the system used by the coder is such that any other person who uses the system will also end up with the same result.\n\n\n2.4.2 Surveys\nThere are two main kinds of studies covered in CS5005:\n\nCross-Sectional Studies\n\n\n\n\n\nCross-Sectional Study Conducted in the Straits Times\n\n\n\n\nThese surveys are based on a sample at a single time.

However, the same people may not be followed up on.\nPanel Studies\n\n\n\n\n\nAn Example of a Panel Study\n\n\n\n\nThis kind of study surveys the same people over time.\n\n\n\n\n2.4.3 Experiments\nTo perform an experiment, one identifies their independent and dependent variables (i.e., IVs and DVs). The IVs are manipulated.\nParticipants of the study also get randomly assigned to different conditions of the IV. The results obtained from the IVs should be compared against those with the control group.\n\n2.4.3.1 Criteria for Determining Casual Relationships\nThere are three main conditions:\n\nCorrelation\nIt must be statistically significant.\nTime order\nThe independent variables of a study must come before the dependent variable of a study.\nNon-spurious relationships\nSpurious relationships can cause weird conclusions. Some examples of spurious relationships can be found here.\n\n\n\n2.4.3.2 Types of Experiments\nThere are three main kinds covered in CS5005:\n\nPre-test and post-test design\nPre-test and a post-test with control1\nPost-test-only design"

This series was shown to the public (particularly military members) to boost their morales and influence their public attitudes.\nThe American government also commissioned a team of researchers to find out how effective Capra’s films were in influencing public opinion - they found out the following:\n\nThere were no profound effects.\nThere was evidence that there was a motivational change in soldiers.\nPerhaps it could be due to a “ceiling effect”?\n\n\n\n3.2.1.2 Payne Fund Studies\nIn 1928, there were concerns over the effects that movies had on children.\nHence, Edgar Dale studied 1500 films’ contents and classified them. His work showed that more than 75% of the films he analyzed could be put into one of three categories: crime, love, and sex.\nHis findings were as follows:\n\nPhysiological Responses\nThe children showed no physiological responses1, but adolescents showed increase physiological responses.\nBehavioral Responses\nHerbert Blumer administered questionnaires and interviews with children, adolescents, and young adults.\nFrom this, the theory of social learning was developed: children are likelier to imitate characters who are rewarded for their behaviors and are seen as “attractive”."
